## David Chen  

### 2025-05-15 - Started SHA Encoder. Began the initialization of the 512 bit string.

### 2025-05-16 - Created makefile and h header file, debugged problem with memory allocation.

### 2025-05-17 - Continued debugging problem with memory allocation.

### 2025-05-18 - Fixed segfault and overflow error and finished with the creation of the 512 bit string.

### 2025-05-19 - Fixed memory allocation error(I used sizeof(int*) instead of sizeof(int)).

### 2025-05-20 - Started the creation of the 80 word list. Updated README.md file. 

### 2025-05-21 - Continued the creation of the 80 words list, found another source with a more comprehensive guide on creating the encoder.

### 2025-05-22 - Fixed a few bugs, replaced the AND bitwise operator to the XOR bitwise operator, debugged issue with the creation of the 80 words list.

### 2025-05-23 - Fixed the issue regarding the creation of the 80 words list, debugged an issue with the bytes in the word list. 

### 2025-05-24 - Fixed the bytes in the word list(circular shift function added a one instead of a two at the end), finished creating the 80 words list.

### 2025-05-25 - Finished the creation of the four functions for the 80 words list, debugged issue with the calculation at word 59.

### 2025-05-26 - Fixed issue with the calculation at word 59(I did 'j < 59' instead of 'j < 60'). Finished decimal to hex function. Finished encoder. 

### 2025-05-27 - Finished encoder, created PRESENTATION.md

### 2025-05-28 - Continued working on PRESENTATION.md

### 2025-05-28 - Continued working on PRESENTATION.md
